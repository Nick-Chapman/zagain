Sharp words between the superpowers. Tanks in East Berlin. And now, reports the BBC, rumors of a satellite blackout. It's enough to spoil your continental breakfast.

But the world will have to wait. This is the last day of your $599 London Getaway Package, and you're determined to soak up as much of that authentic English ambience as you can. So you've left the tour bus behind, ditched the camera and escaped to Hyde Park for a contemplative stroll through the Kensington Gardens.

Palace Gate

A tide of perambulators surges north along the crowded Broad Walk. Shaded glades stretch away to the northeast, and a hint of color marks the western edge of the Flower Walk.

Flower Walk

Gaily colored flower beds line the walks bending north and west, filling the air with a gentle fragrance. A little path leads northwest, between the trees.

You can see a soccer ball half-hidden among the blossoms.

The spires of the Albert Memorial are all too visible to the south. Passing tourists hoot with laughter at the dreadful sight; nannies hide their faces and roll quickly away.

The Wabe

This grassy clearing is only twenty feet across, and perfectly circular. Paths wander off in many directions through the surrounding thicket.

A shaft of golden sunlight falls across a handsome antique sundial, erected at the exact center of the clearing.

The perimeter of the sundial is inscribed with seven curious symbols and a compass rose, with the legend "TEMPUS EDAX RERUM" emblazoned across the bottom. A triangular gnomon casts a fingerlike shadow that is creeping slowly towards the first symbol.

Lancaster Walk

An impressive sculpture of a horse and rider dominates this bustling intersection. The Walk continues north and south; lesser paths curve off in many directions.

A broad field of grass, meticulously manicured, extends to the east. Beyond it you can see the Long Water glittering between the trees.

A printed notice is stuck into the grass.

Lancaster Gate

A crooked old tree shades the perambulators as they roll south down the Lancaster Walk. Shady paths lead west along an iron fence, and southwest between the trees.

There's an old woman under the tree, struggling to open an umbrella. The stiff east wind isn't making it easy for her.

Time passes.

A strong gust of wind snatches the umbrella out of the old woman's hands and sweeps it into the branches of the tree.

The woman circles the tree a few times, gazing helplessly upward. That umbrella obviously means a lot to her, for a wistful tear is running down her cheek. But nobody except you seems to notice her loss.

After a few moments, the old woman dries her eyes, gives the tree a vicious little kick and shuffles away down the Lancaster Walk.

A cloud of pigeons fills the air! They circle overhead and congregate around a nearby bench, where an aged woman is selling bags of crumbs.

"Feed the birds! Thirty p!" Her voice quavers with heartbreak.

As the wild birds gobble down the crumbs, a glint of red catches your eye. Frowning, you stoop down for a closer look... and gasp with astonishment!

The ruby at your feet is bigger than a walnut, with finely cut facets that sparkle with crimson fire. It must have been in the bag of crumbs.

>[21]take ruby


As you reach down to touch the ruby, a very large bird races out from behind a tree. It snatches away the ruby with its beak, zigzags through a group of tourists and disappears to the east. If you didn't know better, you'd swear that bird was a roadrunner.

"It's time!" shrieks the bird woman.

The east wind softens to a whisper and dies away.

Blowing leaves settle to the ground, and the trees are still. Then a fresh gust blows in from the west.

"Thirty p! Thirty p a bag!" cries the bird woman.

Round Pond

Ducks and swans bob on the sparkling surface of the Round Pond. They share the water with an impressive fleet of toy boats, directed by the excited shouts of children.

Crowded paths radiate from the Pond in many directions.

The perambulator rolls to a stop.

The large bird you saw before is here! You catch a glimpse of the ruby in its beak as it races between the wheels of a perambulator and disappears to the east.

The toy boats are crafted of paper and sticks. They bob freely among the wild birds, who can barely conceal their outrage.

The west wind fills the umbrella the moment you open it. You and your perambulator are blown helplessly eastward onto the grass.

You zoom down a long slope, barely missing several trees and boulders. Peering over the top of the perambulator, you see the Long Water coming closer and closer. Unable to stop, and too stupid to let go of the umbrella, you bravely close your eyes and pinch your nose shut.

Crash!






















Long Water

You're on a shady path that winds along the western shore of the Long Water. Looking south, you can see the graceful arch of a bridge, and beyond it the cool expanse of the river Serpentine.

A charming statue stands nearby.

You see a gnomon, a bag of crumbs, a piece of paper and a broken perambulator here.

Painfully, you regain your footing and snap the umbrella shut.

You wade into the cool, dark water.

Wading

You're standing knee-deep in the Long Water, not far from the western shore.

The missile isn't completely motionless. It's falling very, very slowly towards the Long Water.

Your eyes follow the missile's trajectory downward, where you notice another peculiar phenomenon. It looks like a white door, suspended just above the surface of the water.
WadingWading
>[33]enter door


As you wade to the threshold a familiar roadrunner flutters past. The ruby in its beak gleams enticingly as it slips through the white door.

All color abruptly drains from the landscape. Trees, sky and sun flatten into a spherical shell, with you at the very center. A hissing in your ears becomes a rumble, then a roar as the walls of the shell collapse inward, faster and faster.

"This way, please."

You turn, but see no one.

"This way," the voice urges. "Be quick."

The space around you articulates. "No!" your mind shudders. "That's not a direction!"

"It's a perfectly legitimate direction," retorts the voice with cold amusement. "Now come along."

You step out of the white door.

Meadow

You've discovered a golden meadow, bordered on every side by a dense forest. The air is filled with dragonflies, and the wood echoes with the cry of mourning doves.

The door you just stepped from opens into a toadstool of impossible size. Its broad crown towers over your head like a fleshy umbrella.

A triangular shadow inches across the ground. Its sharp point is sweeping across the toadstool.

The shadow creeps away from the toadstool, and the door in the stem swings shut with a faint creak. You stare in wonder as the door shimmers and fades from view.

A glare lights up the sky! You look up just in time to see a meteor streak overhead.

Summit

The hill you've climbed lies at the southwest edge of a vast wilderness. Towering forests are broken by long tracts of wasteland, rugged plateaus and marshes shrouded in perpetual mist. A brooding sun fills the distant valleys with a sad, dusty light the color of antique brass.

A giant triangle, thousands of feet high, rises above the eastern treetops. Its vertex casts a long shadow across the wood.

As your eyes sweep the landscape, you notice more of the giant toadstools. There must be hundreds of them. Some sprout in clusters, others grow in solitude among the trees. Their numbers increase dramatically as your gaze moves westward, until the forest is choked with pale domes.

The meteor disappears below the horizon.

You feel the ground shudder, and hear a roar like thunder. Then all is still.

Arboretum

A spectacular pergola of arborvitaes arches over your head like a great green Ferris wheel. Its tangled surfaces are peculiarly twisted, making it difficult to tell where the inside ends and the outside begins.

Steep, leafy tunnels curve up into the pergola to the north and south. Other paths lead east and west, into the surrounding hedge.

An abstract sparkling sculpture stands between the tunnels. The words Felix Klein 1849-1925 are inscribed on the base.

A set of children's swings moves slowly back and forth in the humid breeze. Behind them stands a long building, its windows hung with flowers and birds folded from colored paper.

Mounds of dirt are heaped around a dark opening to the east. It appears to be a shelter of some kind.

Several small children are happily chasing dragonflies north of the swing set. Turning south, you see a group of adults (schoolteachers, by the looks of them), wearily digging another shelter like the first.

Suddenly, the umbrella in your hand catches her eye. You watch her expression soften from fear to curiosity.

The girl's eyes brighten with surprise when she sees the piece of paper. "Origami," she squeaks, accepting the piece of paper with a gracious bow.

The girl can't keep her eyes off the umbrella.

Thin Air, on the giant bird

The giant bird soars high over the city, banking left and right with effortless grace. You hear the rhythmic pump of its great wings, wind whipping past your ears... and, far overhead, the drone of approaching aircraft.

A granite crypt lies across the ground. Beyond it rises the mound of an ancient barrow. A black tunnel leads north, into the barrow.

Sudden drops fall away on every side but south, where a flight of stone steps descends the cliff.

Barrow

The splinter's ghostly flicker does little to dispel the gloom of this subterranean passage. Craggy walls bend away to the north and south.

A small hole is visible in the wall.

A clatter breaks the silence! You turn, and watch helplessly as a spiked door crashes down across the south exit.

Something just moved.

You peer uneasily beyond the pool of light around the splinter. Nothing. Then, as your eyes adjust, you descry a vaguely human outline crouched against the tunnel wall.

A voice in your ear mutters, "Barrow wight."

The barrow wight studies you with its red eye.

Ossuary

Naked slopes veer upward on every side, forming a natural hollow that is filled to a depth of several inches with human bones. The only exit is a dark opening to the south.

A giant toadstool is flourishing in the rich fertilizer. The white door in its stem is closed.

A thick, suffocating miasma lingers among the trees; the black earth is squishy with corruption. You can hear dripping liquids and other moist sounds close by.

A big Venus flytrap is growing nearby. Its crimson jaws are wide open, exposing a cavity that gleams with sweet-smelling ichor.

Buzzing angrily, the giant bee hovers close by.

The sweet smell of the flytrap stops the bee in mid-buzz. Forgetting its anger, the insect hovers above the open jaws, then touches down to sample the glistening ichor.

The River

You're on a lifeless strip of sand beside a great river. The water is unnaturally dark and still; ribbons of mist coil across its surface like ghostly fingers, obscuring what lies beyond.

Footpaths wander north, west and northwest. Turning south, you see a magnificent hedge growing in an unbroken wall to the river's edge.

A dark shadow lies across the ground.

As you peer across the river you notice a lone vessel gliding out of the fog.

The oarsman accepts the silver coin and nods at you solemnly.

The last of the shades seats itself in the crowded dory.

The oarsman pushes away from the beach.

Planes of mist close in around the dory, drawing it deeper into the gloom. The only sound is the rhythmic slurp of the oar as it plies the dark, oily water.






















A vague outline emerges beyond the helm. It slowly resolves into a spit of sand, damp and cheerless in the surrounding murk.

The oarsman swings the dory around and lands it with barely a jolt. One by one, the shades slink out of the vessel and drift across the sand like leaves on a breath of wind. Something in the oarsman's gaze compels you to follow them.

Sand Bar

At first glance, this isolated spit seems hopelessly mired in the fog blowing in off the surrounding river. But the sand looks a bit firmer to the south.

With practiced skill, the oarsman pushes his empty dory away from the shore.

Islet

It's impossible to see more than a dozen yards on this fogbound islet. The damp air makes your footsteps sound unnaturally loud as you trudge across the sand at the river's edge.

A lone toadstool has found a home at the water's edge. The white door in its stem is wide open.

A triangular shadow lies across the ground. Its sharp point rests exactly on the open door in the toadstool.

"Gnomon is an island," giggles a voice in your ear.

A roadrunner is perched on the toadstool's crown. The ruby in its beak gleams enticingly.

The roadrunner gives you a curt nod of acknowledgement. Then it flutters off the toadstool, prances through the open door and disappears.

Shack

You're in a metal shack, barely twelve feet square. The oak floor is littered with discarded bits of rope, pulleys and other hardware. A dark light bulb hangs from the ceiling. You can see an exit in the west wall.

A five-foot sphere rests on a bracket in the middle of the floor. Its surface is studded with bolts and crossed with electrical cables, all converging in a boxlike enclosure nearby.

An open white door is set into the east wall.

A paperback book is lying in the corner.

Miles of barren desert lie below, gray and still in the gathering dawn. Black roads radiate outward like the hands of a great clock.

A closed box, locked with a steel padlock, is lying across the ground nearby.

A familiar roadrunner is eyeing you from its perch on the box's lid. The ruby in its beak gleams in the early dawn.

You turn to face an urgent noise behind you. Your heart skips a beat. Two tiny eyes, bright with hunger, black with menace, are glaring at you from only a few feet away.

You hear the noise again. It's like a pebble in an empty can.

The rattlesnake rears its wedge-shaped head. It looks as if it's about to strike!

The roadrunner trots into the room and freezes. Tension mounts as snake and bird study one another, their eyes bright with familiar hatred.

Suddenly the roadrunner explodes into action! It dances around the snake, fluttering off the walls as it tries to grab the hissing reptile in its beak. But the room isn't big enough to support this style of attack; and after a few very close calls, the roadrunner abandons the fray and retreats with a squall of frustration.

The roadrunner nods brightly.

You hold your breath as a gray torpedo scoots under the jeeps and disappears into the shelter. The busy technicians fail to notice the fearless creature plucking the key from its padlock.

Triumphantly, the roadrunner prances back to your side and deposits the key at your feet.

Comfort was clearly not a consideration in the design of this jeep. The seat is narrow and hard, and your shin is scrunched up against a radio bolted to the floor.

Whoever was driving this jeep left it in an awful hurry. There's a wallet on the floor at your feet.

The walkie-talkie hisses quietly.

The radio is firmly bolted to the floor of the jeep. This is probably just as well, because it's big and awkward, probably too heavy to carry. Among its many controls are an oversized dial and a toggle switch.

The dial is calibrated with numbers from 20 to 80. Right now it's set to 53.

The control panel is covered with a bewildering array of instruments, clustered around a heavy-duty circuit breaker.

You lift the handle of the circuit breaker.

The roadrunner hops into view.

"What the... ?" mutters the walkie-talkie.

"I didn't copy, Baker."

"Aw, hell." You hear a flurry of excited voices. "Baker to all units. We have 100% continuity loss towerside. Repeat, zero continuity."

A chorus of expletives fills the airwaves. "Check your idiot bulb, Baker. I replaced two duds last night."

"Able, my bulb lights up real pretty. Is this a scrub?"

"I dunno. Ask the kid if he reconnected the detonator line on X after the continuity check."

A burst of static. "The kid ain't laughin', Able."

The talkie hisses; you make out the word "condenser."

>[374]CLOSE BREAKER


You close the handle of the circuit breaker.

"Hold on, Able. X just woke up again."

A sigh of relief. "Sounds like a wet line somewhere."

"The kid's keepin' an eye on it, Pittsburg. If it dies again before the sequencer takes over, we're gonna have to scrub."

"Roger, Baker. Lotta crossed fingers up here."

A commotion of noise erupts from the walkie-talkie. It sounds like a barking dog.

"Pittsburg to all units." The voice is urgent.

"Baker. What's on, Pittsburg?"

"Stand by, Baker. Some kinda trouble outside."

"Baker, are we holding?"

"Negative, Able. No hold. Pittsburg, get a line on that disturbance and report on the double."

"Will do. Pittsburg."

The harsh light illuminating the tower sweeps away suddenly.

You grasp the rungs of the ladder and pull yourself upward.

The barking on the walkie-talkie continues for a few moments, then dies away.

"Able to Baker. We got a breeze blowin' right in our face! Is TR-4 sleepin' down there?"

"It's worse than that."

"Pittsburg to Baker. Just some buzzard raisin' hell with the dog. I chased it away."

A nervous chortle. "Roger, Pittsburg. Stand by."

"Nix the clowning, Baker."

The searchlight sweeps back onto the tower.

Tower Platform

A metal rail is all that stands between you and a hundred-foot drop.

Miles of barren desert lie below, gray and still in the gathering dawn. Black roads radiate outward like the hands of a great clock.

This narrow platform opens east into a metal shack. A searchlight on the southwest horizon floods the platform in a raw white glare. A ladder is sticking up over the platform's edge.

"Pittsburg to Able. One of our eyes just caught a movement on the tower. Can you confirm? Over."

There's a brief pause. The walkie-talkie crackles.

"Negative, Pittsburg. What're you guys drinking down there?"

"Zero minus seven minutes."

Shack

You're in a metal shack, barely twelve feet square. The oak floor is littered with discarded bits of rope, pulleys and other hardware. A dark light bulb hangs from the ceiling; harsh light streams in through an exit in the west wall.

A five-foot sphere rests on a bracket in the middle of the floor. Its surface is studded with bolts and crossed with electrical cables, all converging in a boxlike enclosure nearby.

An open white door is set into the east wall.

A paperback book is lying in the corner.

You see a slip of cardboard and a burial shroud here.

"Pittsburg to Baker. Whatever we saw up there went home."

"Roger, Pittsburg."

The enclosure is a central junction for the forest of cables connected to the sphere. An access panel on the side is closed.

[Your score just went up by 5 points. The total is now 100 out of 100.]

You slide the blade of the steak knife under the blue wire and pull back on it as hard as you can. The thick insulation cracks under the strain, stretches, frays and splits...

Snap! A shower of sparks erupts from the enclosure. You lose your balance and fall backwards to the floor.

"X-unit just went out again," shouts a voice.

"Which line is it, Baker?"

"Kid's board says it's the detonator. The others look okay. We're lettin' it go, Able. The sequencer's running."

The walkie-talkie crackles for a moment.

"Congratulations."

You turn, but see no one.

"Zero minus fifteen seconds," crackles the walkie-talkie.

"You should be proud of yourself." Where is that voice coming from? "This gadget would've blown New Mexico right off the map if you hadn't stopped it. Imagine the embarrassment."

A burst of static. "Minus ten seconds."

The space around you articulates. It's not as scary the second time.

"Of course, there's the problem of causality," continues the voice. "If Harry doesn't get his A-bomb, the future that created you cannot occur. And you can't sabotage the test if you're never born, can you?"

The walkie-talkie is fading away. "Five seconds. Four."

The voice chuckles amiably. "Not to worry, though. Nature doesn't know the word 'paradox.' Gotta bleed off that quantum steam somehow. Why, I wouldn't be surprised to see a good-sized bang every time they shoot off one of these gizmos. Just enough fireworks to keep the historians happy."






















Palace Gate

A tide of perambulators surges north along the crowded Broad Walk. Shaded glades stretch away to the northeast, and a hint of color marks the western edge of the Flower Walk.

The east wind makes it difficult to walk straight.

Flower Walk

Gaily colored flower beds line the walks bending north and west, filling the air with a gentle fragrance. A little path leads northwest, between the trees.

You can see a soccer ball half-hidden among the blossoms.

The spires of the Albert Memorial are all too visible to the south. Passing tourists hoot with laughter at the dreadful sight; nannies hide their faces and roll quickly away.

Lancaster Walk

An impressive sculpture of a horse and rider dominates this bustling intersection. The Walk continues north and south; lesser paths curve off in many directions.

A broad field of grass, meticulously manicured, extends to the east. Beyond it you can see the Long Water glittering between the trees.

A printed notice is stuck into the grass.

Lancaster Gate

A crooked old tree shades the perambulators as they roll south down the Lancaster Walk. Shady paths lead west along an iron fence, and southwest between the trees.

There's an old woman under the tree, struggling to open an umbrella. The stiff east wind isn't making it easy for her.
Lancaster GateLancaster Gate
>[411]help woman


You begin to approach the old woman, but stop in your tracks.

Her face is wrong.

You look a little closer and shudder to yourself. The entire left side of her head is scarred with deep red lesions, twisting her oriental features into a hideous mask. She must have been in an accident or something.

A strong gust of wind snatches the umbrella out of the old woman's hands and sweeps it into the branches of the tree.

The woman circles the tree a few times, gazing helplessly upward. That umbrella obviously means a lot to her, for a wistful tear is running down her cheek. But nobody except you seems to notice her loss.

After a few moments, the old woman dries her eyes, gives the tree a vicious little kick and shuffles away down the Lancaster Walk.

You stare up at the umbrella.

Passersby begin to gather, craning to see what everyone else is looking at. You hardly notice them. Even when the sirens begin to howl, and the crowd scatters like leaves in the east wind, you can't take your eyes off the umbrella swaying in the branches, back and forth.

A gentle voice whispers in your ear. "It's time."

You bend to pet the roadrunner waiting impatiently at your feet, then hurry off to find a soccer ball. But that slogan keeps echoing over and over in your mind...
